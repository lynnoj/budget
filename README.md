# COMP1930 Project Team 22

## Project Ideas

Our idea originated from a discussion of how we would survive the semester at BCIT. We talked about how we would balance our courses, social life, and finances. Then we had to do a project for our COMP 1930 class, so we decided to create something that could actually help us during out time with BCIT. So we decided to go with "Budget", our budget and expense tracking app.

## Feature

- Add expenses to your account with simple click
- Water stimulate wave effect represents the left budget
- Live 2D animation widget chat box guide you to use the app
- Dark mode based on user preference
- Dynamic nav bar and percentage number to notify users their current budget
